# Platform Rules

In order to facilitate cordial and productive exchanges between protocol customers and whitehats, Sherlock has established a set of rules for whitehats and protocol customers to define proper conduct.&#x20;

Breaking these rules as a whitehat could result in removal or ban from the Sherlock platform and/or withholding of payout.&#x20;

Breaking these rules as a protocol team could result in removal from the Sherlock platform and/or provide cause for breakage of the mutually signed agreement.&#x20;

### Whitehats

#### Ethical Standards

* Adhere to ethical standards and legal guidelines. Any actions that compromise the integrity, privacy, or availability of systems beyond what is necessary for testing are strictly prohibited.
* No harm: Ensure that your testing does not negatively impact users or infrastructure.
* Always default to the assumption that the protocol team has good intentions.
* Do not threaten, blackmail, dox, or otherwise create a negative environment for the protocol customer.
* Do not communicate with the protocol customer outside of the official channel provided by Sherlock
* By submitting a vulnerability through Sherlock, you are agreeing to abide by the outcome of the Sherlock dispute resolution process

#### Testing Environment

* Replicating tests on public mainnet or testnet is prohibited. All testing should be conducted on local forks of either testnet or mainnet.
* Use only authorized environments for testing to avoid any unintended disruptions or security risks.
* Avoid testing with external dependencies and third-party systems not controlled by the protocol customer to avoid any leaks of the potential vulnerability

#### Service Disruptions

* Any denial of service attacks that are executed against project assets are strictly forbidden.
* Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic is not permitted.

#### Vulnerability Disclosure

* Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before they are resolved. Reports must be submitted through the Sherlock platform, and we will notify you when it is safe to disclose.
* Do not discuss (publicly or otherwise) any aspect of a submitted vulnerability without consent from the protocol customer
* Report via Sherlock: Use the official reporting channels to submit your findings.
* Never exploit a vulnerability or threaten to do so
* Do not attempt to rescue funds without the written consent of the protocol customer
* Publicly known bugs or bugs reported in a previous audit are never eligible for payout or reimbursement of deposit

#### Payouts

* Do not try to cajole a protocol customer into paying you. Always use the provided Sherlock resolution mechanisms.&#x20;

### Protocol Customers

#### Ethical Standards

* Do not communicate with the whitehat outside of the official channel provided by Sherlock.
* Do not pay whitehats who submit bugs on Sherlock outside of Sherlock’s designated channel or without Sherlock’s consent.
* Do not claim a bug report is a known or duplicate issue without clear evidence of where it was publicly available before the whitehat’s submission timestamp.
* Always default to the assumption that the whitehat has good intentions.
* By listing your bug bounty program on Sherlock, you are agreeing to abide by the outcome of the Sherlock dispute resolution process.
