# Post-Launch Bounty

**Bug Bounty for Qualifying Customers**&#x20;

Customers are given access to the platform for an unlimited number of Submission Managers as whitelisted by the customer. Customers are given access to free triaging and issue explanations from a verified Security Researcher who has previously demonstrated proficiency with the customer's codebase (often through a Sherlock audit contest).&#x20;

Customers are also given access to Sherlock's full arbitration suite that includes access to the Sherlock Protocol Claim Committee and the UMA Optimistic Oracle to help with dispute resolution. Customers are provided with co-marketing of the customer's Bug Bounty Program according to Sherlock's standard marketing efforts.&#x20;

**Required Fees of Qualifying Customers**&#x20;

The Research Fee includes any goodwill payments.

Qualifying customers are required to make payment to Sherlock as follows: 100% paid within 10 days of latest resolution (Sherlock Judge, Sherlock Protocol Claims Committee, UMA Optimistic Oracle).
