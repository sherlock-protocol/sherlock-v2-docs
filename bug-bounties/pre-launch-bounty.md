# Pre-Launch Bounty

Sometimes there is a period after the fix review has been completed, but before a protocol goes live on mainnet.&#x20;

Sherlock wants to ensure that there is an incentive for whitehats to disclose any bugs that may be found during this period.&#x20;

Why? Because if a whitehat waits until the protocol is live on mainnet, this can result in bad outcomes such as a blackhat exploiting the bug first, or the team needing to do a lengthy and embarrassing re-launch.

Sherlock attempts to mitigate this by creating a "Pre-Launch Bounty" program for every cooperating protocol team.&#x20;

This will be a very small bounty but will increase as the launch date approaches.&#x20;

It also acts as a "check" on the fix review. Before, there was little incentive to give maximum effort during a fix review. Now, the Lead Senior Watson (or whoever conducts the fix review) will only receive a portion of their fixed pay AFTER this Pre-Launch Bounty period has passed and no new Critical bugs were missed during the fix review.&#x20;
