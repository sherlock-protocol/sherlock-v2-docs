## Sherlock Terminology

### Bug Bounty

* A bug bounty is essentially a reward offered to an honest participant who finds a way to exploit a protocol. Black hat hackers are "bad guys" who exploit a protocol directly, leading to losses for all users. White hat hackers are "good guys" who report a potential exploit vector to the protocol team in return for a bug bounty reward (usually USDC).

### Claim

* A claim occurs when a protocol covered by Sherlock receives a bug bounty submission or believes it has been hacked and believes Sherlock has a responsibility to repay the bug bounty or hack. See the [claims section](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/claims/claims-process) for details.

### Coverage

* If Sherlock takes on a protocol as a customer, the "coverage" is the amount of tokens (USDC) that Sherlock will reimburse when a bug bounty submission or exploit (that falls under the coverage agreement) occurs.

### Exploit

* For Sherlock's purposes, an exploit is the act of maliciously removing tokens (usually tokens deposited by others) from a protocol in an unintended way. Sherlock covers most (but not all) exploits that a protocol could experience. For a detailed breakdown of which exploits are generally covered, take a look at our current coverage agreements [here](https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-reports/tree/main/coverage-agreements).

### Premium

* The amount of USDC a protocol pays Sherlock over a specified time interval. In return, Sherlock reimburses covered bug bounty submissions and exploits experienced by the protocol over that same time interval.

### SHER

* Sherlock's token which is still in development. See the [SHER section](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/tokens/sher) for more info.

### Watsons

* "You know my methods, Watson. There was not one of them which I did not apply to the inquiry." - _The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes_ (1893)
* Watsons are the individuals without which Sherlock would be nothing. These are the security experts who do the deep fundamental research (audits) that allows Sherlock to confidently provide coverage for a given protocol's smart contracts.
