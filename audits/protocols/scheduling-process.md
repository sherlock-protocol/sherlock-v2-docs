  How to reserve and confirm an audit slot with Sherlock, including deposits,
  start date confirmation, and scheduling flexibility for both major releases
  and update reviews.

# Scheduling Process

Sherlock keeps scheduling lightweight so teams can lock review time without freezing code weeks in advance. After an initial assessment and a preliminary quote, scheduling follows a straightforward flow.

#### **Step 1: Reserve a slot**

The protocol reserves a review slot with a **25% deposit and proposes a preferred start date.**

Sherlock confirms staffing and the start date shortly after reservation. If the proposed date is not feasible, Sherlock will suggest alternatives and work with the team to select a new start date.

#### Step 3: Deposit flexibility

If Sherlock cannot accommodate the originally proposed start date, the protocol may withdraw the deposit in full.

#### Scheduling notes

Teams can often schedule on short notice, especially for narrower scopes and update reviews. For larger or higher-stakes releases, earlier scheduling gives more flexibility on dates and staffing and reduces the chance of timeline compression close to launch.
