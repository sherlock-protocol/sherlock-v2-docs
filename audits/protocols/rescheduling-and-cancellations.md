# Rescheduling and Cancellations

### Rescheduling and cancellations

Protocols often schedule audits before a codebase is fully ready to freeze. That’s normal. Sherlock keeps rescheduling practical, but review time is also real capacity that gets reserved and staffed in advance.

#### Rescheduling

If you need to move an audit start date, notify Sherlock as early as possible. Sherlock will make a good-faith effort to accommodate a new date based on staffing availability and the scope<br>

If the audit start date is blocked due to protocol readiness (for example: required access is missing, payment is incomplete, the code is not frozen, or other audit readiness requirements are not met), Sherlock may treat the reserved slot as used capacity. In these cases, the deposit may be applied to compensate reserved reviewer time, and the engagement can be rescheduled once readiness is confirmed.

#### Cancellations

If you need to cancel an engagement, contact Sherlock as early as possible. Refundability depends on how much reviewer time has already been reserved and committed. In general, the closer the cancellation is to the scheduled start date, the less likely the deposit is to be refundable.

#### Practical guidance

To avoid last-minute issues:

* schedule early, but plan to freeze the scope and commit close to the start date
* use the Audit Requirements Checklist to confirm readiness ahead of the 3-day freeze point
* flag risks early (delayed tests, pending migrations, major refactors, access limitations) so the review plan can be adjusted\
