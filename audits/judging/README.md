# 🧑‍⚖️ Judging

### Phase 1: Real-Time Judging

> What's the purpose of this phase? To quickly crowdsource (with advanced signal scores) judgments, explanations, and de-duplication for each issue to reduce the workload for the Lead Judge.&#x20;

* Happens right after the audit contest ends
* Lasts a fixed number of days (# of issues / 100) days (for example 500 issues would be 5 days), with a minimum of 2 days.
* Dedicated Judges sign up ahead of time to give certainty that all issues will be judged and de-duplicated by the end of this period
* Often, 90% of issues are judged accurately within 12-24 hours, allowing a protocol team to start on any fixes

The Dedicated Judges need to judge all issues during the fixed number of days. See [Dedicated Judge](audits/real-time-judging/dedicated-judge.md) for more details.

### Phase 2: Lead Judge

> What's the purpose of this phase? Real-Time Judging often surfaces controversial and/or complex issues that are best judged by a top-tier security expert.&#x20;

* The Lead Judge will know his start date as soon as the contest ends (if 500 issues then he starts 5 days after the contest ends)
* Lead Judge gets (# of issues / 200) days to do this preliminary judging, with a minimum of 2 days. (so 500 issues would round up to 3 days)
* Lead Judge only needs to focus on the controversial issues (flagged in Real-Time Judging) during this phase
* Lead Judge must write an explanation for every judgment
* The Lead Judge may begin judging before the official start date.

### Phase 3: Escalation Period

> What's the purpose of this phase? Sometimes a Watson will want to flag something they believe the Lead Judge got wrong.&#x20;

* After the preliminary results are announced, Watsons have 24 hours to flag any issues for re-review
* &#x20;Watsons must pay with their Signal Score to flag an issue
* Watsons can then leave an extra comment explaining their rationale

### Phase 4: Final Lead Judge Judgments

> What's the purpose of this phase? The Lead Judge will re-review any issues flagged during the Escalation Period. The Sherlock Judge will supervise and interject if needed.&#x20;

* The Lead Judge gets (# of controversial issues / 20) days to complete Phase 4, with a minimum of 2 days.
* Lead Judge will review all controversial issues (new ones from the Escalation Period and old ones that he already judged)
* Lead Judge will make final decisions on all controversial issues
* The Sherlock Judge will closely monitor the decisions during Phase 4, be available for any questions, ask questions if something is unclear, and only overturn a decision if it’s clearly wrong.
