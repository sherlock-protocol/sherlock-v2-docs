# Judging Conduct Guidelines

Being a Judge for a customer’s audit contest is a highly privileged role. A high degree of professionalism is expected from every Judge.

To be a Judge on Sherlock, the following rules should be observed:

* No comments should be written that disparage Sherlock, a Sherlock team member, the customer, a customer’s team member, or other Judges
* No vulgar, spam or off-topic comments should be written
* No attempt to break or game the judging system should be attempted
* If any issue with the judging system is discovered, it should be reported to the Sherlock team immediately
* Discussion of issues can be highly sensitive, so please keep the discussion to the comments section for issues in Real-Time Judging or the appropriate channel on Discord
* No discussion of judging on an external public channel (such as X/Twitter, a non-Sherlock Discord server, etc.) should occur

If any of the above guidelines are not followed, a temporary or permanent ban from judging and removal of the Sherlock Judge role will follow.&#x20;
