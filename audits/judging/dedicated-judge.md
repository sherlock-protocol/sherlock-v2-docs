# Dedicated Judge

The offer to be a dedicated judge will be available in the Sherlock Discord's Judging channel. The signup deadline is 24 hours before the audit contest ends. There are only 5 dedicated judges for the public contests (top 5 with highest signal out of those who signed up), and only 3 dedicated judges for the private contests.

**Requirement**

The dedicated judge must review all issues before the community judging period ends, with a target of assessing 100 issues per day.

**Penalty**

If the dedicated judge doesn't manage to judge all the issues before the end of community judging, they will receive a penalty.

1. You will not receive the 300% reward boost. Like any other judge, you will receive a 100% reward boost.
2. Your leaderboard signal score will be decreased by 50%, this is a significant penalty.

**Reward**

If you don't receive the penalty and successfully fulfil your obligations as a dedicated judge. You will receive a 500% reward boost.

This boost applies to your

1. USDC pool rewards
2. Signal rewards
3. Signal penalty

Note that incorrect judging amplifies your penalties; this will increase the drop in signal score due to the boost.

### Early November Update

This update applies to all judges, but is especially relevant for the dedicated judge.

Previously, the risk/reward ratio remained constant, with both risk and reward increasing at a steady rate over time. With this update, however, the risk/reward ratio will gradually increase over time.

Before this update, judging uncertain issues was generally penalizing. Now, it’s less penalizing, making it advantageous to judge issues you’re unsure about closer to the deadline.
