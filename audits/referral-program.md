# Referral Program

### Referral program basics

* Anyone in the world can refer protocol teams to Sherlock!
* If the team does an audit contest or collaborative audit
  * You'll make 5% of the rewards to security researchers (everything except Sherlock's fee)
    * Example: If the rewards are 100k USDC, you'll make 5k USDC for your referral
* Once a contest is fully paid, Sherlock will ask the protocol team if anyone referred them. If they mention you, then you get paid :moneybag:
  * You can also ping us ahead of time (or introduce us to the protocol in the first place) to ensure that your referral is not overlooked. At the end of the day, it will be up to the protocol team's word to decide if you referred them or not.&#x20;
* Sherlock will only pay out 1 address for each referral, meaning we won't split referrals between multiple people, that will be up to you and anyone you work with
  * Referral payouts will be done in USDC on Ethereum mainnet or Polygon
