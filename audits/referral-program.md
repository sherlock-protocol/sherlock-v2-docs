# Referral Program

## Sherlock Partnership Program

Sherlock offers a referral program for teams and individuals who introduce protocol teams to Sherlock. Qualified referrals earn 10% of the total amount the customer pays for Sherlock audits and Sherlock AI subscriptions.

### Overview

The Sherlock Partnership Program is for ecosystem operators who regularly advise protocol teams on security decisions. Sherlock owns evaluation, scoping, contracting, and delivery. Partners are paid when referred teams purchase.

### How it works

Referrals are submitted through the program form or via an introduction thread that includes Sherlock.

Sherlock runs evaluation, scoping, contracting, and delivery.

Referral payouts are issued after customer payments are received and cleared.

### Compensation

**Audits:** 10% of the total audit cost paid by the customer for qualified referrals.

**Sherlock AI:** 10% of the total subscription amount paid by the customer for qualified referrals, paid each billing period while the subscription remains active.

### Referral qualification

A referral is qualified if:

1. The referred team is not already in an active sales process with Sherlock at the time of submission.
2. The referral is submitted through the program form or through an introduction thread that includes Sherlock.
3. The referred team purchases within the attribution window.

Referrals remain eligible for 180 days from submission.

### Payout timing

Audits: paid after the customer’s payment is received and cleared by Sherlock.

Sherlock AI: paid after each subscription payment is received and cleared, aligned to the customer’s billing cycle.

### Program integrity

Sherlock attributes referrals to the first qualified submission on record. Sherlock may decline referrals involving spam, misrepresentation, or low-integrity outreach. If a customer payment is refunded or reversed, the associated referral payout may be reversed or offset
