question,description,order
On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?,"Please list every chain explicitly. E.g. Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base",1
"If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?","Please specify the token standards, whether you want to use only certain implementations or any tokens, and what weird traits can these tokens have. Also, feel free to provide examples of the tokens you intend to use. Please make sure they do not exhibit any [weird traits](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20).

Tokens with 6 to 18 decimals are not considered weird.",2
"Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?","This question applies to all access-restricted functions in the codebase, including out-of-scope contracts. Access-restricted functions are only callable by a protocol role (Owner, Keeper, FeeManager, or any custom role specified in the codebase). Also, list any hardcoded variables that you plan to change and the values you plan to apply.

It's possible to answer ""No."" and not put any limitations on possible values.

Example answer: 
- Owner is trusted
- Keeper is not trusted
- FeeManager is only trusted to collect the fees correctly",3
"Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in protocols you integrate with, including restrictions on array lengths?","Same as above, except this applies to access-restricted functions of protocols you integrate with.

It is common to answer ""No,"" as protocols typically trust the governance of the protocols they integrate with.",4
Is the codebase expected to comply with any specific EIPs?,"Please explain the underlying intention behind integrating with each EIP, and how compliance with these EIPs aligns with your protocol's goals.",5
"Are there any off-chain mechanisms involved in the protocol (e.g., keeper bots, arbitrage bots, etc.)? We assume these mechanisms will not misbehave, delay, or go offline unless otherwise specified.","Please provide information on how these off-chain bots (e.g., keeper bots, arbitrage bots) read and process on-chain data.",6
What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?,"For example, the invariant is the amount of the underlying tokens must equal the amount of vault tokens. Even if breaking this invariant has a low impact, it could be assigned Medium severity. You can answer ""No"" if there are no specific invariants you want to hold.",7
Please discuss any design choices you made.,"For example: ""We chose to ignore fees in some calculations because they unnecessarily overcomplicated formulas, but didn't have practically any impact on the final result. But, if this approximation may cause a serious loss of funds, it may be a valid finding.""",8
Please provide links to previous audits (if any) and all the known issues or acceptable risks.,Listing the audits provides context to Watsons and invalidates findings acknowledged in these audits. Additionally, issues listed in this question will also be considered Invalid as known or acceptable findings.,9
Please list any relevant protocol resources.,"Please link to the docs, whitepaper, and the website for Watsons to gather context on the audit.",10
Additional audit information.,"If you'd like to specify what areas would you like Watsons to look into, this is a perfect place to do so.
In case you forked any contracts, please provide a diff from the original ones. You can also provide a diff of the contracts after your last audit(s). This will direct Watsons' focus on the least battle-tested parts.",11
