# 🛡️ Sherlock Shield

Welcome to Sherlock Shield!

Every protocol team that goes through a Sherlock audit gets access to bug bounty and exploit coverage on their audited code.&#x20;

Here's how it works:

1. Complete an audit with Sherlock
2. Complete the fix review
3. Sherlock pays for a small pre-deployment bug bounty
4. Confirm your 1-click bug bounty program
5. Once you launch, Sherlock covers up to $250k of bug bounty and exploit payouts

After completing the fix review, Sherlock ensures that there is always a bug bounty on your code! With Sherlock's dual pre-deployment and post-deployment bug bounties, whitehats will be working around the clock to keep your protocol safe.&#x20;

### Coverage Amount Criteria

The amount of coverage Sherlock gives is based on the vulnerabilities found in the Sherlock audit:

Each Medium severity vulnerability is worth 1 point, and each High severity vulnerability is worth 5 points. Like golf, you want your score to be as low as possible so you can access the maximum amount of coverage:

| Points       | Coverage Amount |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Less than 3  | $250,000        |
| Less than 6  | $200,000        |
| Less than 9  | $150,000        |
| Less than 12 | $100,000        |
| Less than 15 | $50,000         |
| Less than 18 | $25,000         |
| Less than 21 | $10,000         |
| Less than 30 | $5,000          |
| 30 or more   | $1,000          |

Note: Sherlock does not guarantee payment or the availability of funds. Payouts are determined by the [on-chain claims process](claims/) of the Sherlock protocol on Ethereum mainnet. Please review the [Sherlock Disclaimers](../disclaimers.md) to better understand the coverage offering.&#x20;
