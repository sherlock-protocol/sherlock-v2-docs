# Customer Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: October 4, 2025**

Sherlock ("We," "Us," or "Our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Sherlock collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards your information when you use our website, our services including collaborative audits, audit contests, bug bounties, and our AI audit product ("Sherlock AI"), or otherwise interact with us. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or California, you may have additional rights under applicable data protection laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), UK GDPR, or California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We act as a data processor for certain data related to our Services, particularly code and repository data accessed via Sherlock AI.

Key Points:

* We prioritize data security: Your code and personal information are handled with enterprise-grade protections, including encryption and access controls. We do not use your proprietary code for AI training without explicit consent.
* Limited data collection: We collect only what's necessary for providing Services, such as account details, usage data, and code snippets for vulnerability disclosures.&#x20;
* No unnecessary sharing: Data is shared only with authorized service providers or as required by law; we do not sell your data.
* Enterprise considerations: For large organizations, we offer data processing agreements (DPAs), support for GDPR/CCPA compliance, and options for data residency. Research suggests that tools like ours must balance innovation with privacy, and we lean toward strict controls to build trust.
* User rights emphasized: You can access, delete, or opt out of certain processing; however, evidence from industry guides indicates that complete data anonymity in AI tools is challenging, so we provide transparent opt-outs where possible.

#### What Information We Collect

We collect personal data (e.g., name, email, IP address) when you create an account or contact us, and non-personal data like code snippets and vulnerability reports during audits. For Sherlock AI, we access GitHub repositories with your permission to scan pull requests (PRs) for vulnerabilities, but we do not store your code except snippets needed in vulnerability reports.&#x20;

#### How We Use Your Information

Data is used to deliver Services, improve security insights, and comply with legal obligations. For AI audits, a proprietary codebase is analyzed in real-time but not stored long-term.

#### Your Privacy Choices

Request access or deletion via support@sherlock.xyz. CCPA residents: We do not sell personal information.
